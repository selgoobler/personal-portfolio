      "Selina was one of my teammates for our Grace Hopper Program capstone project. I found myself continually impressed by her incredible drive and curiosity; she was always willing to put in extra work to learn new technologies (like Firebase) and was never deterred by roadblocks we encountered. Selina's excellent communication skills top-notch work ethic, and inquisitive nature would make any team very lucky to work alongside her.",
