      "Selina was one of my teammates for our Grace Hopper Program capstone project. I found myself continually impressed by her incredible drive and curiosity; she was always willing to put in extra work to learn new technologies (like Firebase) and was never deterred by roadblocks we encountered. Selina's excellent communication skills top-notch work ethic, and inquisitive nature would make any team very lucky to work alongside her.",

      "Selina and I were part of a four-person team to build a mock e-commerce website in the Grace Hopper program. Throughout the challenges of learning new approaches under a tight timeline, she was easy to communicate and collaborate with while maintaining a positive perspective. She helped to make a valuable learning experience even better with her upbeat, focused, and professional attitude.",
