    learned:
      'In a span of two weeks, my team and I took the initiative to learn new technologies including Firebase authentication, React Hooks, Progressive Web Applications, React Bootstrap, and Cloud Firestore NoSQL. We navigated through documents and tutorials to guide us, as our bootcamp instructional team were not familiar with most of the technologies. ',
    goal: 'What inspired us to pursue this project was our user experience for popular nutrition logging applications like MyFitnessPal. We aimed and successfully created an application that had individualized nutritional goals, as well as provided recommendations based on user progress.',

    learned:
      'We learned new technologies such as JWT authentication, Stripe API for checkout and React Bootstrap for styling. We learned how to work as a team of full stack developers, had code reviews with instructional team, and had daily standups with our team lead. Non technical skills such as communication, teamwork, collaboration, and empathy were necessary for our project.',
    goal: 'Over the course of 4 days, my team and I created an e-commerce website using our full stack web development knowledge and skills, acquired from the junior phase of the Grace Hopper program. ',

    learned:
      'To create the mobile application, I researched React Native and learned about the difference in Android and iOS syntax and styling. Because I primarily use iOS, I decided to pursue an iOS mobile application. Additionally, I learned Expo Go to test styling, functionality, and user experience',
    goal: "For Grace Hopper's weekend 'stackathon' project, I was encouraged to explore new technologies. Because the curriculum doesn't include mobile applications, I was curious and dove into React Native and Expo Go for an iOS application. ",
